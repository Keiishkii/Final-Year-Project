Since the inception of the video game industry, there has been the continued interest in developing new hardware solutions for players to use when interacting with video games. Beginning in 1971, with the invention of the arcade cabinet; followed by the first consumer home console, the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972; the first motion controlled game console, the Nintendo Wii, in 2006; and now the continuous iterations we see happening with virtual reality (VR) headsets today. All of this, for the purpose of increasing enjoyment and delivering new and exciting experiences to the players. There are many different and highly successful user input systems used within the industry today. The most successful of which are the mouse and keyboard, quickly followed by the large variety of generic hand-held console controllers. On top of this we have; motion control systems like the Wii remote, the Xbox Kinect and the PlayStation Move; Virtual reality systems like the Pico Neo, HTC Vive and the Oculus Quest; and other more unique solutions for input like the Guitar used in Guitar Heroes, and the recent example of Nintedo's Labo Toy-Con's. With the markets continued interest in new experiences, large gaming companies will continue to innovate new methods of interaction to deliver.
